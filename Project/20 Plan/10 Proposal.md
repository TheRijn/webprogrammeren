# Project Proposal

You'll spend the first <strong>three days</strong> building a *proposal document*. It paints a fairly complete picture of what your application will look like, how the user will interact with it.

> Writing a good proposal document will help you successfully finish the project on day 18. Your project has a high risk of failure if:
>
> - the envisioned product tries to do too much
> - the envisioned product doesn't do enough
> - the purpose of the product is not well-defined (too vague)
>
> By writing a clear proposal document and getting feedback on it from multiple students and teachers, you can easily avoid these risks.

These are the expected contents of your proposal document:

- a definition of the target audience of your application

- an overview of what features will be available

- a visual sketch of what the application will look like for the user

- which external components (online APIs, libraries etc.) you will need to make certain features possible (name and URL link)

- technical problems or limitations that could arise during development and what possibilities you have to overcome these

- a review of similar mobile apps or related visualizations, in terms of features and technical aspects (what do they offer? how have they implemented it? can you do it in the same way?)

- which parts of the application define the *minimum viable product* (MVP) and which parts may be optional

## GitHub

All documentation and code of this project must be hosted on GitHub and updated
daily, in order for the staff to be able to monitor your progress. Please note
that the repository must be public!

To create such a document and get your project started, complete the following
steps:

1. Go to <https://github.com/new> and create a new code repository. Check the box to initialize the repository with a readme document:

   ![Check Initialize this repository with a README](readme.png)

2. Edit the plain text document called **README.md**. The **.md** extension indicates its *Markdown* formatting style. Have you never written Markdown before? Refer to the [reference](/reference/markdown) for more information. Write your proposal in that document.

   The proposal document should be well-written and clearly formatted. Do not forget to include a
   title, your name, and a paragraph summary of the application goals at the top.

3. As you will need to include some sketches into your proposal, put these images in your repository.

4. Discuss the contents with fellow students and the teaching crew *before* handing it in!

5. Now, copy the URL of the GitHub page for your project and submit it below. It will be in this format: <https://github.com/stgm/project>.

> Don't commit any code yet! Your repository should be clean for us to read, containing the **README.md**, a **doc** folder (exactly that name), pictures in the **doc** folder, and nothing else.
